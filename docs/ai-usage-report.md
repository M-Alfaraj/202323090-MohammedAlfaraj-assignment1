Tools Used & Use Cases

Chatgpt: Used for generate code snippets to help solve problems and give examples of topics about Javascript and CSS. I mainly Used it for:
1-Implementing dark Mode by a CSS class and toggling between light and dark themes using javascript.
2-Creating a session based system to display an alert only once during a session.
3-debugging CSS issues and improving styling aspects like box shadows.


Benefits & Challenges

Benefits: ChatGPT helped me improve and learn new concepts about CSS and Javascript that I needed to know. such as displaying with flex to help order some elements in the file. And box shadow with transition to help make the boxes look better. I also used it to debug my code, fix syntax errors, and ensure that the final version was clean and refined.

Challenges: Sometimes, chatGPT sometimes gave responses that did not match my requirements. And sometimes, it would give me incorrect statements that will not work for my assignments. So, I had to explain what i wanted in more detail to ensure it would give me useful statements that would help me understand certain topics and help me finish the assignment.


Learning Outcomes
I improved my understanding of CSS by using flex display to order elements in the webpage and using shadow properities to make borders look more smooth and easy to look at. I also learned how to use new keywords in javascript to interect with the frontend of the webpage and change the design of the page to change it between light mode and dark mode. I also learned how to create an alert to display a message when anyone enters once per session.


Responsible Use & Modifications
All AI-generated code and suggestions from chatGPT were used to learn and understand the code rather than using the code unmodifed. I also added comments to help make it easier to find code related to certain parts of the html structure, and Javascript code was explained where needed. AI was also used to suggest new ideas and improvements to take into consideration to help make the page better, adjustments and ideas from chatgpt were taken with consideration and all were coded by me based on my understanding.
