Tools Used & Use Cases
Chatgpt: Used for creating code snippets to help solve problems and give examples of topics about Javascript and CSS. I mainly Used it for:
1-Dark Mode implemetation method of how to use a CSS class to create dark mode features and switch between it and light mode using javascript.
2-Creating a session based system and displaying an alert when someone opens the webpage for a session only once.
3- debugging mistakes with CSS and asking for help regarding aspects like box shadows.

Benefits & Challenges
Benefits: ChatGPT helped me improve and learn new concepts about CSS and Javascript that i needed to know. such as displaying with flex to help order some elements in the file. And box shadow with transition to help make the boxes look better. I also used it to debug my code to ensure there are incorrect working and typos and make sure that the code is clean and refined.

Challenges: Sometimes, chatGPT could give me statments that did not fit what i was looking for. And sometimes, it would give me incorrect statements that will not work for my assignments. So, I had to explain what i wanted in more detail to ensure it would give me useful statements that would help me understand certain topics and help me finish the assignment.

Learning Outcomes
I improved my knowledge in CSS by using flex display to order elements in the webpage and using shadow properities to make borders look more smooth and easy to look at. I also learned how to use new keywords in javascript to interect with the frontend of the webpage and change the design of the page to change it between light mode and dark mode. And also create an alert to display a message when anyone enters the webpage and control it to only display once when the page is first entered by using a session based system.

Responsible Use & Modifications
All Code and information generated from chatGPT was used to learn and understand the code rather than using the code unmodifed. I also added comments to help make it easier to find code related to certain parts of the html structure, and Javascript code was explained where needed. AI was also used to suggest new ideas and improvements to take into consideration to help make the page better, adjustments and ideas from chatgpt were taken with consideration and all were coded by me based on my understanding.
